What is a default constructor ?

Default constructor is the one which get called on creation of an object of a class.
It is used to initialize the data members of a class to specific values.

eg :

class A
{
	public:
		A()
		{
			// Default constructor
		}
}

int main()
{
	A obj; // This calls the default constructor.
	return 0;
}
